This program solves linear programming problems using the simplex method.  It's
not efficient at all, but it may be useful to somebody out there as a learning
tool.  Just type 'make' in directory, and it hopefully it will install.  Tested
on ubuntu and arch linux.

I made this program over 6 months ago to avoid writing out tableaus in my
optimization class, and I am afraid I am not sure if I could still give a good
explanation of the tableau method.  If you're not sure what to do, type "help"
into the prompt.  In example.txt I have included an example of how to use the
program to solve simple linear programs.

Quirks that I can remember: I believe that when it goes into a two phase
solution, the added variable is called x1, and all the other variables are
shifted over 1.  There might be other problems.  Just email me if you have a
question and I'll take a look
